# Battle-Chess

This is my first project ever, written as my A level coursework. 
I post it here to have reference on how I improve over time, as well as I'm quite sentimental and I can't just delete all of this code.

If you'd like to see my actual abilites, please check out "Island Deployed" project, it is (mostly) the same game, but completely re-written and re-designed.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this code.
